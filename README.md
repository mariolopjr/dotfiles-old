# Dotfiles ![CI](https://github.com/mariolopjr/dotfiles/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development
environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run
multiple times.

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot][dotbot] for installation.
